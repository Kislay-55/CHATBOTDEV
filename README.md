# 📝 Autocorrection Tool  

## 📌 Problem Statement  
Writing mistakes such as spelling errors, wrong word choices, and lack of clarity reduce the **quality and professionalism of communication**.  
Traditional spell-checkers only correct obvious errors but fail to:  
- Suggest context-aware alternatives  
- Provide clear meanings of words  
- Highlight the most suitable word for the sentence  

This creates barriers for students, professionals, and writers who want to **write quickly, accurately, and effectively**.  

---

## 🎯 Objective  
To build an **AI-powered autocorrection tool** that not only detects spelling mistakes but also:  
1. Suggests **multiple alternative words with meanings**  
2. Highlights the **most contextually relevant word**  
3. Provides a **user-friendly and responsive interface**  

---

## 🔄 Current Progress  
- ✅ Designed a responsive web-based interface with three main windows:  
  1. **Input Window** → For entering text  
  2. **Suggestions Window** → Displays spelling corrections + word meanings  
  3. **Best Match Window** → Highlights the closest and most suitable word  

- ✅ Integrated a basic dictionary + spelling checker module  
- ✅ Prototype running with simple test cases  
- ⏳ Currently working on **context-aware AI suggestions** for better accuracy

## 🛠️ Prototype Solution  
Our prototype addresses the problem by combining **spell-check + word suggestion + meaning extraction** in one place:  

- When a user enters text, the system:  
  1. Detects spelling mistakes in real-time  
  2. Provides a list of suggestions with their meanings (dictionary integration)  
  3. Selects and displays the **most contextually accurate word** in a separate window  

This ensures **faster writing, fewer mistakes, and better word choice**.
